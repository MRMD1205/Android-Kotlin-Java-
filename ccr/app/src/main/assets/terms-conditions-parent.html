                    <p>
                        Children must be ready for transport at the time stated by the office or driver, or after 5 minutes, the driver is authorised to leave. Similarly, at school in the afternoons, should the child not be prepared for transport home within 15 minutes of the end of the school day - the driver is authorised to leave. The parents of child/carer must be at home at the drop-off time; the child cannot be dropped off at home without an adult present, unless this is supported in writing and authorised by Transport Coordination Centre (TCC). We cannot drop off children to an alternative address, even as temporary measure - unless authorised by TCC.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At pick-up / drop-off, the driver and escort will remain in/by the vehicle – children must be bought to/from the car as we cannot be responsible for children outside of the vehicle. Any behaviour which affects the driver’s ability to safely provide transport can result in the immediate suspension of transport. Our staff are permitted to refuse transport should it seem clear that a child’s behaviour at pickup is unsuitable for transport.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any information you can give to our staff with regards to how to best approach and deal with your child’s behaviour during their journey is much appreciated!
                    </p>
                    <p><u>
                            Under no circumstances, should your child share their contact number with Driver/Passenger Assistant.</u>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below are points of contact for the office and out-of-hours numbers. Please could you inform the office immediately of any changes to contact details for parents/assigned carer for child (in absence of parent) so our systems are up-to-date at all times.
